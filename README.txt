These codes were created by Marcelo M. Guzzo, Leonardo J. F. Leite, Sany Willian P. Novelo and V. Pleitez as part of the article [https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13118][Published version: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.107.095037].

The master file is Gamma.nb, which can be opened and edited in Wolfram Mathematica (version recommended is 12.1).

The first section generates the expressions for the uncertainty in the quantities calculated.

The second section defines the numerical values of the different quantities involved.

The third secton defines the quantities to be calculated and to generate the data.

The fourth and fifth sections generate the data for the decay rates and for chi^2 function respectively.

Next, we use the Python scripts to plot these results.

Files 'RegionSigmaslog.py', 'RegionSigmas.py', 'Region1sigma.py' and 'Chisqr.py' make use of the chi^2 data generated in section 5 and plot the regions and values of chi^2 function.

The remaining .py files show the decay rates for each decay channel and ratio, according to their title.
